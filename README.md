# text-analyzer-with-word-visualizer
A web app that uses P5.js and RiTa to track and visualize word frequencies when the user submits a text file. Other features include: word / syllable / sentence counter, a basic statistics calculator, and a Flesch-Kincaid readability level calculator. Finally, users can also input 1-3 key words to see all the context sentences surrounding the words, all on one page. Includes web files for the user interface. Word visualization adapted from Daniel Shiffman's example sketch on concordance.
